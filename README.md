This example demonstrates a potential runtime type error in TypeScript.  While TypeScript's type system helps catch many errors during compilation, certain situations can lead to unexpected behavior at runtime if not handled properly. This specific example shows that type checking might not work across every boundary and may lead to unforeseen errors in complex applications. The solution involves using stricter type guards or runtime checks to enhance type safety.
